the .cxx and hxx files are for minGW 2.05
The .cpp and .h files should be used if your using Visual Studio 2017

minGW
main.cxx is used for testing the class.
clsLinkedlst.cxx is the implementation file.
clsLinkedlst.hxx is the definition header file.

Visual Studio 2017
ConsoleApplication1.cpp is used for testing the class.
clsLinkedlst.cpp is the implementation file.
clsLinkedlst.h is the definition header file.
I'm not including "stdafx.h" as this should be a part of the visual studio project when its created.
